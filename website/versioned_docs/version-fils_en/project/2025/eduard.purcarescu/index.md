## Description
The project uses an ultrasonic sensor to help the user see the objects within a certain radius on a display and if an object is closer than a set distance, it uses a servomotor to shoot it. Another servo is used to constantly rotate the turret. After shooting, it stops and waits for a button to be pressed in order to reset.

## Motivation
Since I was little, I've always liked shooting games and I can say I wanted to do this project in order to remember my childhood and also something in order to gain more knowledge in software and hardware domain. I didn't like the games which didn't have a radar or a minimap, that is why I integrated also the lcd display.

## Architecture
1. Raspberry Pi Pico 2W: the brain of the operation. It receives information from the sensor and analyses what to send to the display and servomotor
2. Micro servomotor: shooting function
3. Metallic servomotor: used for automatic rotation of the turret
4. Ultrasonic sensor: measures the distance to an object and then sends it to the microcontroller
5. LCD display: displays objects seen by the ultrasonic sensor, behaving like a mini radar
6. Push button: serves as a reset function after an object has been shot
7. Breadboard: interconnects all the pieces
